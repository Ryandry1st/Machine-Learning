This folder contains code that is generally done by either piecing together parts from various tutorials, or through individual research.

The focus is on creating a neural network with a higher degree of accuracy (about 85%) for sentiment analysis. In the small tutorials, a neural network was made which could do 65% accuracy, which was not impressive. Then a larger one was implemented which had 75% accuracy but was very poor at predictions. This was scaled up to a much larger neural network, with 15 epochs and training for 24 hours, which yielded 76.5% and barely better predictions. 

The most recent strategy implements a recurrent neural network using the same lexicon from before, and with keras and word embeddings, it can reach about 81% after a few hours of training. Its predicitons are generally good, especially if the words used are known to it. 

The next strategy will be to look into increasing the size, tuning some parameters, and seeing if around 83% is managable. I have not determined my next step for reaching a new tier of accuracy, but it will likely be a different network configuration.
