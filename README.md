# Machine-Learning
Going through tutorials on Machine Learning and the basis for how to use data science tools with Python.

The primary source for tutorials is by going through the videos hosted by Sentdex at https://pythonprogramming.net/machine-learning-tutorial-python-introduction/

The use of stock data is taken, manipulated, and used with simple regression tools to train a classifier and test it. Tools like pickle are used to reduce the need for internet connections (due to very restrictive local internet hosts preventing many common apps like whatsapp, Facebook, and, in this case, Quandl for data.

Another file goes through the classic Iris flower classifier and some of the methods found in scikit.

There is generally an example of a classifier, like SVM or K-Nearest_Neighbors, along with another set of code which derives how that code works.

The seperate folder for neural network code is also done through tutorials by Sentdex, and will be added with tutorials through tensorflow and keras as well.
