# Machine-Learning
Going through tutorials on Machine Learning and the basis for how to use data science tools with Python.

The primary source for tutorials is by going through the videos hosted by Sentdex at https://pythonprogramming.net/machine-learning-tutorial-python-introduction/

Tools like pickle are used to reduce the need for internet connections (due to very restrictive local internet hosts preventing many common apps like whatsapp, Facebook, and, in this case, Quandl for data, as well as to reduce the need to recalculate things like neural networks.

There is generally an example of a classifier, like SVM or K-Nearest_Neighbors, along with another set of code which derives how that code works.

The seperate folder for neural network code is also done through tutorials by Sentdex, and will be added with tutorials through tensorflow and keras as well.

Doing the larger neural network code, especially training the NN, takes hours using the cpu version with the current code. I will be putting the checkpoint in so that the network will not need to be retrained unless desired.
