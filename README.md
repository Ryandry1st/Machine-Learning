# Machine-Learning
Going through tutorials on Machine Learning and the basis for how to use data science tools with Python.

The primary folder contains code that was developed through the tutorials hosted by Sentdex at https://pythonprogramming.net/machine-learning-tutorial-python-introduction/

The use of stock data is taken, manipulated, and used with simple regression tools to train a classifier and test it. Tools like pickle are used to reduce the need for internet connections (due to very restrictive local internet hosts preventing many common apps like whatsapp, Facebook, and, in this case, Quandl for data.

Another folder contains code going through the classic Iris flower classifier and some of the methods found in scikit.
