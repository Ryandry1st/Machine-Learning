# Machine-Learning
First, tutorials on Machine Learning and the basis for how to use data science tools with Python are attempted in the Machine learning folder. Most of these are from keras or early tensorflow. All of the code here is most likely out of date but the concepts are true.

The primary source for tutorials is by going through the videos hosted by Sentdex at https://pythonprogramming.net/machine-learning-tutorial-python-introduction/

There is generally an example of a machine learning method, like SVM or K-Nearest_Neighbors, along with another set of code which derives how those functions work within the machine learning folder.

The third folder specifically focuses on my own project, which is creating or improving a neural network for sentiment analysis. I initially started with the NN from the tutorial, and have changed some preprocessing to allow for word embedding, as well as a RNN and CNN neural network architectures. The goal is for greater than 85% accuracy, with the RNN at about 81.1% currently.

*The most recent work is the DL_Hands_On file which is a collection of the information and work obtained from going through chapters 10-14 of Machine Learning with Scikit-learn and TF 2.0 by Aurelion Geron. This is the most recent work and contains a lot of good information about neural networks. If you would like to see better examples of recent code, this is the place to start.*
