Documents in this folder are for Neural Networks, specifically done through tutorials.

It begins with the simple MNIST dataset which gives around 97.5% accuracy with a classic NN.
Then a small positive or negative text sentiment NN is developed which produces about 65% accuracy.
A larger sentiment NN is implemented in the Sentiment folder, which takes many hours to finish training 10 epochs and produces about 75% accuracy.
  There are files like the model and lexicon which can be used without needing to retrain the NN then.

A Recurrent NN for the MNIST dataset is then added, which shows improvements even for image data, to about 98.5% accuracy.
Then a convolutional NN is attempted for the MNIST dataset, however it actually only shows about 98.5% as well. A larger dataset should improve this.

Finally TFlearn is used to create a convolutional NN, which is very clean and easy to do. This actually got up to 99.7% after just three epochs. Not convinced this is correct though, because that is crazy accurate compared to the CNN done with just tensorflow

I will be looking into doing some more opportunities, maybe other different tutorials or attempting my own with a new dataset, or improving the big sentiment to hopefully get about 85% accuracy. I would think a RNN and a neutral label would improve this greatly.
